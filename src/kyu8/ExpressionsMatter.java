Expressions Matter

Task

    Given three integers a, b, c, return the largest number obtained after
    inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
    In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained
    Consider an Example :

With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3 , here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

    1 * (2 + 3) = 5
    1 * 2 * 3 = 6
    1 + 2 * 3 = 7
    (1 + 2) * 3 = 9

So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.
Notes

    The numbers are always positive.
    The numbers are in the range (1 â‰¤ a,b,c â‰¤ 10).
    You can use the same operation more than once.
    It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
    Repetition in numbers may occur .
    You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.

Examples:

expressionsMatter(1,2,3)  ==>  return 9
Explanation:
After placing signs and brackets, the Maximum value obtained from the expression (1+2) * 3 = 9.

expressionsMatter(1,1,1)  ==>  return 3
Explanation:
After placing signs, the Maximum value obtained from the expression is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

expressionsMatter(9,1,1)  ==>  return 18
Explanation:
After placing signs and brackets, the Maximum value obtained from the expression is 9 * (1+1) = 18.
